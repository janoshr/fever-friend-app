fever-medication,5,Fever temperature?,,"Maybe you are more nervous than you should be, or did you feel bad for the feverish child? A high fever alone does not justify the administration of medicine. If a patient is given fever and pain relievers for the purpose of improving their malaise, this also inhibits the functioning of the immune system. Therefore, in the future, try to be a little calmer and more patient, and to improve the feeling of well-being in other ways, for example by poultices and washing."
dehydrated-infant,7,Stay hydrated!,,"When the fever rises, children do not want to eat or drink. For a breastfed baby, breast milk is the best fluid replacement. If they regurgitate or vomit, you can try again with a small amount after 5-10 minute breaks. If they don't want to be breastfed, or if your baby is not breastfed, you can offer lukewarm water in small spoonfuls."
dehydrated-child,6,Stay hydrated!,,"When the fever rises, children do not want to eat or drink. It can help if we offer them warm, pleasant liquid that they asks for or accepts from a spoon at a time. We offer it again and again, but not forcefully. Do not wake the sleeping child. When the body has reached the target temperature and the fever peaks, the child is usually thirsty."
dehydrated-feverish-child,6,Stay hydrated!,,"When the fever has reached its peak, children are more willing to drink. Basically, all liquids are suitable for fluid replacement, except cow's milk or sugary carbonated soft drinks. Herbal and fruit teas (possibly with a little honey), diluted fruit juices, water, still mineral water are the most suitable. Among the teas that have traditionally worked: 1) linden blossom, elderflower for fever. 2) chamomile for abdominal pain. 3) for restlessness, lavender, lemongrass. 4) for a sore throat, chamomile, elderflower, for gargling: sage."
pale-child,4,Keep them warm!,,"If the child's skin is pale, marbled; their limbs are cold/cool; maybe they are shaking from the cold, they are not feeling well; lethargic, depressed, it may indicate that their temperature is still rising. In this case, they don't need cooling, but heating. Cover them, apply warm compresses to their limbs (wrist, lower leg) and put a warming bottle under their cold soles."
